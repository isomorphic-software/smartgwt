// This script will load all of the Isomorhic SmartClient Application Framework libraries for you

// The idea is that in your app file you can just load the script "Isomorphic_SmartClient.js" which
// in a production situation would be all of the scripts jammed together into a single file.
//
// However, it's easier to work on the scripts as individual files, this file will load all of the
// scripts individually for you (with a speed penalty).
