/**
 * CSS color specification applied to a specific HTML element on this page. <P> This is a string matching the syntax as
 * specified in CSS1, and can be formatted in one of the following ways: <ul> <li>A keyword color, &ldquo;white&rdquo;</li>
 * <li>Six-digit hex notation, &ldquo;#ffffff&rdquo;</li> <li>Three-digit hex notation, &ldquo;#fff&rdquo;</li> <li>8-bit
 * decimal notation, &ldquo;rgb(255, 255, 255)&rdquo;</li> <li>Percentage notation, &ldquo;rgb(100%, 100%,
 * 100%)&rdquo;</li> </ul> <P> Note that when working with {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.chart.FacetChart}s, it's
 * required that colors be specified using the six-digit hex format listed above, rather than any of the others, since the
 * Framework needs to perform math on the subfields.  Affected properties include {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.chart.FacetChart#getDataColors FacetChart.dataColors}, and affected methods include  {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.chart.ColorMapper#getColor ColorMapper.getColor()}
