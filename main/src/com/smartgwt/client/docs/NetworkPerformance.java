/**
 * <h3>Network Performance</h3>
 * This section describes various methods for optimizing delivery of your Smart GWT-based
 * application to the browser.  The various techniques discussed here should enable you to
 * drastically reduce the time to load your Smart GWT based application and to cut down on
 * bandwidth costs and server-side CPU usage. <P> <i>Note that in addition to these network
 * performance considerations, you should also be aware of the recommended application design
 * practices discussed in {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.SmartArchitecture}.</i> <P> There are
 * three main ways of improving the performance of your application: <p> <u><b>Compression</b></u>
 * <p> You'll want to deliver as much of your application assets compressed as possible.  For a
 * start, the Smart GWT modules come pre-compressed.  The {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.Compression} section describes how to make sure that Smart GWT modules
 * and your application logic are delivered compressed and how to enable dynamic compression of
 * your dynamic content. <p> Compression drastically reduces transfer times to the browser. 
 * Compression ratios for css and javascript files can be as high as 8:1. <p>
 * <u><b>Caching</b></u> <p> The {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.Caching} section deals with
 * delivering as much content as possible with caching headers.  Setting these headers allows the
 * end-user's browser and any intermediary proxies to keep a local copy of the file across browser
 * reloads, ensuring the subsequent visits require almost no fetches from the server.  Eliminating
 * these fetches is also important for the reasons explained under File Assembly below.  <p>
 * <u><b>File Assembly</b></u> <p> Modern browsers limit the number of HTTP connections they use
 * to fetch the assets required to render your pages - typically to just 2 connections.  As a
 * result, connection latency can play a much higher role than available bandwidth and the two
 * connection limit effectively drastically limits the user's usable bandwidth.  For this reason,
 * it's important to minimize the number of HTTP requests made to the server.  The File Assembly
 * services make it easy to deliver multiple css and javascript file via one HTTP response. 
 * Assembling files together also helps to increase the compression ratio because the compression
 * engine has more redundant data to work with. <p> <u><b>FileLoader</b></u> <p> The FileLoader is
 * a standalone client-side module that allows you to performing caching or loading of various
 * resources in the background on any page.  The typical usage pattern is to use this module to
 * pre-cache Smart GWT modules, skin images, and application logic while the user is, for example
 * filling in a login form.  See the FileLoader documentation on usage. <p> <u><b>SSL
 * Considerations</b></u> <p> Some quirks to be aware of when optimizing for pages serviced via
 * HTTPS: <ul> <li>If your top-level https page loads an image via http, IE will pop a warning to
 * the user asking if it's ok to serve the "unsecure" content.  Firefox does not pop an alert, bug
 * shows a different lock icon to indicate that not all content is served from a secure server.
 * <li>Firefox will not write images fetched via SSL to disk, even if expires headers are set. But
 * it will cache them in memory for the duration of the browser session.  This makes the use of
 * the FileLoader even more important for SSL applications.  IE will cache SSL content across
 * browser restarts. <li>If your only concern is with actual security and not with perception, it
 * makes a lot of sense to serve the top-level page via plain HTTP and then use the Smart GWT RPC
 * mechanism to fetch sensitive data with no-cache headers via HTTPS.  Unfortunately this almost
 * never practical because most users look for the secure lock icon on the top-level page and may
 * become worried that the application is not secure if they don't see it. </ul> <p> <u><b>Other
 * Tips</b></u> <p> 1.  Modern applications often use a number of cookies to keep track of session
 * state, application state, etc.  If you don't limit the paths these cookies are served for, you
 * can easily end up with these cookies being sent to the server with every HTTP request as part
 * of the HTTP headers.  This can severely limit bandwidth where a large number of requests are
 * made - typically for skin images.  Also note that most technologies used by end-users to
 * connect to the internet such as DSL and Cable are half-duplex, meaning that downstream must
 * pause for upstream traffic to be sent and these connections also are asymmetric, allowing much
 * faster download speeds than upload speeds.  As a result, the limited upstream capability of
 * most connections ends up limiting the download bandwidth by delaying the download of other
 * assets required to render the page. <p> 2.  Whenever possible, don't set the "Cache-Control"
 * header to "private" - this tells intermediary proxies to not allow caching of the specified
 * content, eliminating that cache as a useful intermediary for other users behind it. <p> 3.  For
 * a good overview of performance considerations, see this post: <a
