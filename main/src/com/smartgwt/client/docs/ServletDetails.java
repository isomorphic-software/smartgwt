/**
 * <h3>The Core and Optional Smart GWT servlets</h3>
 * The following is a description of the servlets and filters you'll find in the web.xml file
 * contained in the smartclientRuntime and what they do: <p> <i>Core Functionality</i> <ul>
 * <li>Init servlet - see the article on {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.ServerInit Smart GWT
 * Server Initialization}</li> <li>IDACall servlet - <b>required</b> for {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.DmiOverview DMI}, built-in RPC operations and built-in DataSource
 * operations to work.  All databound examples in the SDK use this servlet.  If you're planning on
 * using a custom actionURL for all your RPC requests, then you don't need this servlet.
 * <li>FileDownload servlet - required for serving the Isomorphic framework code compressed and
 * with caching headers as well as for serving skin images with caching headers.  It is highly
 * recommended that you use this for production but is not required.  <li>PreCache servlet - loads
 * resources into memory on container startup.  Not required, but if you exclude this servlet
 * there may be a slow response to the very first request. <li>jsp-config section - the iscTaglib
 * registration block is required to use &lt;isomorphic&gt; tags, and the *.isc and *.rpc
 * mappings.  These are optional, if you want to use these as handy development tools. </ul> <p>
 * <i>Optional Functionality</i> <ul> <li>RESTHandler servlet - handles Smart GWT Server
 * DataSource operations issued by  REST clients: it's like IDACall, but for the REST protocol. 
 * Typically,  the clients of this servlet would not be ordinary Smart GWT/SmartGWT applications
 * (though they  could be), but other client technologies that need to access Smart GWT DataSource
 * operations as reusable services.  If you do not plan to connect to the server using the REST
 * protocol, then you don't need this servlet. <li>AxisServlet - exposes all DataSource operations
 * via a WSDL service described by  SmartClientOperations.wsdl.  This is effectively the same as
 * the RESTHandler servlet, but  for SOAP clients.  If you do not plan to connect to the server
 * using webservice protocols, then you don't need this servlet. <li>HttpProxy - used by the
 * RPCManager when sending AJAX RPCs to a server other than the server that serves the main
 * application page.  You need to install this servlet if, for example, your application will be
 * querying web services exposed by servers other than the server that is serving the rest of the
 * application.  See the javadoc for this servlet for various configuration options, such as how
 * to restrict the URLs that are allowed to be proxied.  <li>MessagingServlet - used by the
 * realtime messaging system.  If you're planning on using this subsystem, you'll need this
 * servlet. <li>CompressionFilter - required if you want to use dynamic compression of html and js
 * files. <li>JSSyntaxScannerFilter - development tool that looks for trailing commas in JS source
 * (scans html files for &lt;script&gt; tags and scans .js files in their entirety). This is a
 * useful development tool, but should not be included in production. <li>NoCacheFilter -
 * development tool that makes any content it intercepts non-cacheable in order to ensure
 * developers are looking at the latest version of a file when modifying examples.  Not for
 * production use. <li>DataSourceLoader - a servlet that returns the definition of one or more
 * DataSources in JavaScript notation.  This servlet is provided as an alternative to using the 
 * <code>&lt;isomorphic:loadDS&gt;</code> JSP tag, and is particularly suitable in environments
 * where JSP tags can't be used for some reason (such as with SmartGWT).  See  {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.DataSourceDeclaration Creating DataSources} for more details.
 * <li>ScreenLoaderServlet - a servlet that returns the definition of one or more screens in
 * JavaScript notation.</li> </ul> Note that not all of the servlets and filters listed under
 * <i>Optional Functionality</i> above are present in the web.xml that ships with the
 * smartclientRuntime - if you need to use any of these, copy their configuration from the web.xml
 * available under the WEB-INF directory of smartclientSDK.  Other servlets, filters and
 * configuration files from the smartclientSDK should not be copied to your deployment, simply
 * because the SDK includes many developer tools that are not extensively audited from a security
 * standpoint.
