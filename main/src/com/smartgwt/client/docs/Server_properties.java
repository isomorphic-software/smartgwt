/**
 * <h3><code>server.properties</code> file</h3>
 * The <code>server.properties</code> file is a configuration file read by the Smart GWT server.
 * It contains miscellaneous server settings - see the file itself for documentation  and default
 * or sample settings. <P> Note that this is a standard Java Properties file, except it allows
 * variable substitution from other properties defined earlier in the file. <P> It's loaded from
 * the <code>CLASSPATH</code>, so it can be anywhere in the  <code>CLASSPATH</code>, but is
 * typically either in the projects java "src" directory or in <code>WEB-INF/classes</code>. <P>
 * Server side code can access and modify the properties specified in this file via the
 * <code>com.isomorphic.base.Config</code> class
