/**
 * A <code>Callback</code> is an arbitrary action to be fired - usually passed into a  method to be fired asynchronously as
 * a notificaction of some event.<br> The <code>callback</code> can be defined in the following formats:<ul> <li>a
 * function</li> <li>A string containing an expression to evaluate</li> <li>An object with the following properties:<br>   
 * - target: fire in the scope of this target - when the action fires,       the target will be available as
 * <code>this</code>.<br>     - methodName: if specified we'll check for a method on the target object with this       
 * name.<br>  </li></ul> <code>Callbacks</code> are fired via the  Class.fireCallback() method, which allows named
 * parameters to be passed into the callback at runtime. If the Callback was specified as a string of script, these
 * parameters are available as local variables at eval time.<br> For specific Smart GWT methods that make use of
 * <code>Callback</code> objects, see local documentation for information on parameters and scope.
