/**
 * <h3>Smart GWT Server Summary</h3>
 * The Smart GWT Server is a set of Java libraries, servlets and tools that provide the key
 * server-side components needed to build a complete application in the modern web architecture.
 * <P> The Smart GWT Server can be {@link iscInstall integrated} into any pre-existing Java
 * application, and is designed to rapidly connect Smart GWT visual components to pre-existing
 * Java business logic or persistence engines.  Smart GWT's Ajax request processing facilities can
 * be easily integrated into  {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.SpringIntegration Spring
 * controllers} or custom servlets and JSPs. <P> Alternatively, the Smart GWT Server provides a
 * complete SQL and Hibernate-based persistence engine for new applications, with out-of-the-box
 * servlets for processing Ajax data requests. <P> The Smart GWT Server is optional, and Smart
 * GWT's client-side Ajax engine can be integrated with any server that provides HTTP access,
 * using XML, JSON, SOAP or proprietary data protocols.  However any server in a modern web
 * application will be required to provide most or all of the features of the Smart GWT Server
 * (described below), and the Smart GWT Server represents a best-of-breed implementation of these
 * facilities with a long history of high-volume production deployments. <P> <h4>Server
 * enforcement of {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.validator.Validator Validators}</h4> <P>
 * Data passed from the browser can be automatically validated by the Smart GWT Server. In
 * contrast, when using {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.ClientDataIntegration client-side
 * integration}, data arrives as HTTP params or XML messages, and you must parse values into the
 * correct types (eg java.util.Date) and validate them, or use a server framework that does so.
 * <P> <h4>High Speed Data Delivery / Data Compression</h4> <P> The Smart GWT Server delivers data
 * to and from the browser using a proprietary, maximally efficient protocol, providing simple
 * Java APIs for sending and receiving data. <P> Smart GWT's data protocol is: <ul> <li>
 * automatically compressed: provides 6-8x improvement in bandwidth utilization <li> efficient on
 * the server: high speed data serialization for any Java Object <li> efficient in the browser:
 * faster than ordinary XML or JSON data delivery <li> minimal: facilities for {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#getDropExtraFields trimming} and {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getValueXPath extracting} only the data you want the
 * browser to see </ul> <P> <h4>Transparent upload support</h4> <P> Smart GWT provides special
 * client and server-side support for {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.Upload file\n upload}, which
 * allows single and multiple-file HTTP uploads to be performed as a background Ajax request
 * without reloading the page or launching sub-windows. <P> Uploaded files arrive at the Smart GWT
 * server as Java InputStreams accessible from the DSRequest object, and can optionally be
 * automatically stored via Smart GWT's SQL subsystem. <P> <h4>Transparent Queuing / "Batch"
 * Operations</h4> <P> Any request transmitted to the Smart GWT Server can be combined into a
 * "queue" transmitted as a single HTTP request, with in-order execution for all queued
 * operations.  {@link com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCManager#startQueue startQueue()} starts a queue
 * and {@link com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCManager#sendQueue sendQueue()} transmits it; queuing is
 * transparent to the code that initiates the individual requests.  This enables: <ul> <li> re-use
 * of data access operations across different screens <li> easy implementation of transaction
 * boundaries <li> simplified saving and loading of screens with complex, master-detail views <li>
 * guaranteed in-order processing of operations <li> more efficient network usage </ul> <P>
 * <h4>Reify</h4> <P> {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.Reify Reify} is included with the Smart GWT
 * Server, and uses server features such as automatic SQL binding to provide a rapid prototyping
 * environment. <P> <h4>Automatic Bi-directional Java &lt; - &gt; JavaScript serialization and
 * translation</h4> <P> Provides a powerful, type-safe {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCRequest#getData data transmission mechanism} for moving data between
 * a Java server and the browser.  <P> Any Java objects, including Java Beans, POJOs, Java
 * Collections, XML DOMs and all Java primitives, with any level of nesting, can be automatically
 * serialized and delivered as JavaScript Objects to the Smart GWT client-side components. <P>
 * JavaScript Objects existing in the browser can likewise be automatically transmitted to a Java
 * Server and translated to Java Objects, with any level of nesting and automatic preservation of
 * primitive types. <P> <h4>SQL and Hibernate connectors</h4> <P> DataSources of serverType:"sql"
 * or serverType:"hibernate" can generate and execute queries against popular SQL engines or
 * against the Hibernate ORM system, providing Smart GWT's {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.DataBoundComponent}s with the four standard CRUD operations
 * (create, retrieve, update, delete) without writing any server-side code.  For rapid
 * prototyping, these DataSources can even generate SQL tables based on the DataSource
 * declaration, using the {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.AdminConsole Admin Console} visual tool.
 * <P> Server-side APIs allow server-side modification of the request before it is executed (for
 * example, to enforce security) and post-processing of the request after execution (for example,
 * to provide calculated values). <P> Both serverType:"sql" and serverType:"hibernate" support the
 * field-operator-value queries that can be generated by using the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.FilterBuilder} component (see <a
 * href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#grid_nested_filter_builder"
 * target="examples">example</a>). <P> <h4>Rich, Standardized Request / Response protocol</h4> <P>
 * The Smart GWT Server provides a standardized request and response protocol designed for
 * data-oriented "CRUD" operations (create, retrieve, update, delete). <P> This standardized
 * protocol automatically handles {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest request metadata}
 * (paging parameters, requested sort order, original values of data being modified) and {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DSResponse response metadata} (error handling, cache management,
 * session expiration etc). <P> This standardized protocol avoids developers in different groups
 * inventing their own incompatible and redundant request/response protocols, and allows
 * developers to more easily learn code they didn't author. <P> <h4>Bi-directional XPath binding
 * to Java Objects</h4> <P> Most UI designs do not directly reflect the underlying Object model
 * and so some degree of translation is necessary in order to populate UI components with data and
 * apply user changes to the Java Object model.  This is often accomplished with brittle,
 * difficult to understand data translation code sprinkled throughout the system, done in a
 * different way for every screen or component. <P> Smart GWT provides a standard, {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getValueXPath XPath-based approach} to adapting any
 * Java-based Object model to the requirements of the UI design.  Data relevant to the application
 * UI is centrally extracted in the server-side {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource} layer,
 * so that all UI components have a consistent, unified view of the data model for both loading
 * <b>and</b> saving data. <P> <h4>Broadest possible browser support</h4> <P> The Smart GWT Server
 * can compensate for facilities  {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.PlatformDependencies missing or
 * disabled in certain browsers}, including ActiveX being disabled in IE6 and missing XML support
 * in some versions of Apple's Safari browser. <P> <h4>Transparent Proxying</h4> <P> {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCManager#sendProxied Proxying} allows Smart GWT applications to
 * access web services, RSS feeds, HTML content and other data services in a secure manner
 * regardless of where they are located: across the enterprise or publicly available. <P>
 * <h4>Optional {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.NetworkPerformance Network Performance}
 * Module</h4> <P> Provides: <ul> <li> compressed delivery of Smart GWT runtime, application logic
 * and other assets such as CSS <li>  background download of Smart GWT and other assets for zero
 * user-perceived load time <li> on-the-fly stripping and combining of JavaScript (application
 * code and data) <li> browser cache control </ul> <P> <h4>Optional Messaging Module (aka server
 * push)</h4> <P> The {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.Messaging Messaging} module allows the
 * server to "push" messages to the client, without client polling, for real-time
 * monitoring/dashboarding applications.
