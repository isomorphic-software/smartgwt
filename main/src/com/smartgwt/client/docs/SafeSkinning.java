/**
 * <h3>Safe Skinning</h3>
 * The skinning mechanism is extremely powerful and gives you the ability to change internal
 * functionality of components.  While this is useful for workarounds, you should think through
 * any properties you override, considering what will happen with future versions of Smart GWT,
 * where the defaults may change or be expanded. <P> The following kinds of overrides are
 * generally very safe: <ul> <li> Change {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getStyleName
 * styleName} or {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Button#getBaseStyle baseStyle} to provide a
 * custom CSS style or series of styles <li> Change a media path such as the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Img#getSrc src} of the  {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Window#getMinimizeButton Window.minimizeButton}. <li> Change the
 * size of any part of the UI that has a fixed pixel size, such as the height and width of the
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Window#getMinimizeButton Window.minimizeButton}, especially
 * when this is done to match the size of media you have created <li> Set properties such as
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Button#getShowRollOver Button.showRollOver} that cause a
 * component to visually react to more or fewer UI states (disabled, over, down, etc) </ul> The
 * following should be very carefully considered: <ul> <li> Adding custom behaviors by passing in
 * event handlers such as  (eg {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#addShowContextMenuHandler
 * showContextMenu()}).  If future versions of the component add more functionality, you may
 * prevent new features from functioning, cause them to function only partially, or break. <P> If
 * you want to ensure that you do not break new functionality added in future Smart GWT versions,
 * be sure to call  Super() for methods you override, and do not prevent events from bubbling. <P>
 * If you want to ensure that <b>only</b> your custom behavior is used if a future version of a
 * Smart GWT component adds functionality, override all methods involved in the interaction, even
 * if your methods do nothing.  For example, for a custom drop interaction, override dropOver,
 * dropMove, dropOut and drop, even if you do nothing on dropMove().  Then, do not call Super() if
 * there is no superclass behavior required for the interaction you've implemented.  Also, for any
 * event handlers (such as drop()) return false if you consider your code to have completely
 * handled the event (no parent component should react). </ul> The following are not recommended:
 * <ul> <li> Providing a global {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getID ID} to a
 * subcomponent (only works once). <li> Overriding {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getBackgroundColor Canvas.backgroundColor}, {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getBorder border}, {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getMargin margin}, {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getPadding padding}, or in general any single attribute
 * otherwise controlled by CSS.  Future Smart GWT versions may change the base CSS style,
 * rendering your single-property customization senseless.  Change the entire CSS style via {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getStyleName styleName} instead. </ul>
