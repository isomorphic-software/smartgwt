/**
 * <h3>Don't Misuse Frames</h3>
 * Loading the Smart GWT framework into multiple frames or iframes within the same browser is not
 * a supported configuration, or more accurately, not a <i>supportable</i> configuration, for the
 * following reasons: <ul> <li> each additional frame multiplies the memory footprint and reduces
 * speed <li> having multiple frames prevents drag and drop between components in different frames
 * <li> modality handling (eg modal dialogs) doesn't automatically take into account multiple
 * frames (consider tabbing order, nested modality and other issues, you'll see it's not realistic
 * to provide automatic cross-frame modality handling) <li> inter-frame communication triggers
 * several browser bugs: memory leaks, performance issues, intermittent crashes in some browsers,
 * inconsistencies in basic JavaScript operators such as "typeof", and problems with form focus
 * handling in IE, among many other bugs </ul> None of these problems are specific to Smart GWT. 
 * They happen with Ajax frameworks in general as well as other RIA technologies.  This is why no
 * successful Ajax application has ever used the approach of double-loading a component framework
 * into multiple frames. <P> The recommended {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.SmartArchitecture
 * Smart GWT Architecture} involves loading as many Smart GWT-based application views as possible
 * in the first page load, then showing and hiding different views as the user navigates through
 * the application. <P> If, for whatever reason, you cannot follow the Smart GWT Architecture and
 * must load new Smart GWT-based views by contacting the server each time, use the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.ViewLoader} class to load new views, never frames. <P> Note that
 * the use of IFrames is appropriate in certain circumstances, including loading certain types of
 * content within an {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.HTMLFlow contentsType,HTMLFlow}.  The only
 * prohibited usage is loading the Smart GWT framework into multiple frames within the same
 * browser.
