 * Strings to identify the various keys on the keyboard. <ul> <li>  For alpha keys, the single (uppercase) character value
 * is used, such as "Q" <li>  For Numeric keys, the number is used as in a single character string, like "1" <li>  Function
 * keys are identified as <code>"f1"</code> - <code>"f12"</code> <li>  Non alpha-numeric character keys (such as the key
 * for "[" / "{") are identified by       their unmodified character value (the value obtained by hitting the key without  
 * holding shift down), by default - exceptions are listed below. <li>  Additional key names:<br>      -
 * <code>Space</code><br>          - <code>Tab</code><br>          - <code>Enter</code><br>      - <code>Escape</code><br>
