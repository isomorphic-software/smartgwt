/**
 * <h3>Client-Server Integration</h3>
 * Like client-server desktop applications, Smart GWT browser-based applications interact with
 * remote data and services via background communication channels. Background requests retrieve
 * chunks of data rather than new HTML pages, and update your visual components in place rather
 * than rebuilding the entire user interface. <P> <b>DataSources</b> <p> First you must create
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource DataSources} that describe the objects from your
 * object model that will be loaded or manipulated within your application.  All of  Smart GWT's
 * most powerful functionality builds on the concept of a DataSource, and because  of Smart GWT's
 * databinding framework (see {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.DataBoundComponent}), it's as
 * easy to  create a DataSource that can configure an unlimited number of components as it is to 
 * configure a single component. <P> For background information on how to create DataSources,
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.DataBoundComponent bind} components to DataSources and
 * initiate {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest}s, please see the <em>Data  Binding</em>
 * chapter of the <em>Smart GWT Quickstart Guide</em>. <P> <b>Data Integration</b> <P> DataSources
 * provide a data-provider agnostic API to Smart GWT Visual Components that  allow them to perform
 * the 4 CRUD operations (<b>C</b>reate, <b>R</b>etrieve,  <b>U</b>pdate, <b>D</b>elete).  By
 * "agnostic" we mean that the implementation details -  the nuts and bolts of how a given
 * DataSource actually retrieves or updates data - are  unknown to bound Smart GWT components. 
 * One effect of this is that DataSources are  "pluggable": they can be replaced without affecting
 * the User Interface. <p> When a visual component, or your own custom code, performs a CRUD
 * operation on a DataSource, the DataSource creates a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest}
 * (DataSource Request) representing the operation. "Data Integration" is the process of
 * fulfilling that DSRequest by creating a corresponding {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DSResponse} (DataSource Response), by using a variety of possible
 * approaches to  connect to the ultimate data provider.   <p> There are two main approaches to
 * integrating DataSources with your server technology:  <ul> <li>{@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.ServerDataIntegration Server-side integration}: DataSource requests
 * from the browser arrive as Java  Objects on the server. You deliver responses to the browser by
 * returning Java Objects. The various server-side integration possibilities are discussed later
 * in this article.</li> <li>{@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.ClientDataIntegration Client-side
 * integration}: DataSource requests arrive as  simple HTTP requests which your server code
 * receives directly (in Java, you use the  Servlet API or .jsps to handle the requests).
 * Responses are sent as XML or JSON which you  directly generate.</li> </ul> The possible
 * approaches are summarized in the diagram below. Paths 2, 3 and 4 are  client-side integration
 * approaches, and path 1 includes all server-side integration  approaches.  <p> <img
 * src="skin/ClientServerIntegration.png" width="866px" height="495px"> <p> Smart GWT supports,
 * out of the box, codeless connectivity to various kinds of common data providers, including SQL
 * and Hibernate.  Smart GWT also provides functionality and tools for accelerated integration
 * with broad categories of data providers, such as Java Object-based persistence mechanisms (JPA,
 * EJB, MyBatis, in-house written systems), and REST and WSDL web services in XML or JSON formats.
 * Ultimately, a DataSource can be connected to  anything that is accessible via HTTP or HTTPS,
 * and also to in-browser persistence engines  such as <a href='http://gears.google.com'
 * target='_blank'>Google Gears</a>. <p> <b>Choosing a Data Integration Approach</b><p> This
 * section aims to help you decide which of the many possible data integration approaches is best
 * for your particular circumstances.  The recommendations given here will guide you to the
 * approach that involves the least effort.<p> <img src="skin/dataIntegrationFlowchart.png"
 * width="640px" height="300px"> <p> <ul> <li>If you have a Java server:</li> <ul>   <li>If your
 * ultimate storage is a SQL database:</li>     <ul>       <li>Use the SQLDataSource unless you
 * have a very large amount of pre-existing           JPA or Hibernate code - small amounts of
 * business logic can be easily migrated.           Be sure to read the overview of {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.SqlVsJPA SQLDataSource vs JPA/Hibernate}            in order to
 * understand the large benefits the SQLDataSource provides</li>       <li>Derive DataSource
 * definitions from existing tables or Hibernate mappings using the           {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.serverds.DataSource#autoDeriveSchema autoDeriveSchema} feature, or
 * from Java Beans           via the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.serverds.DataSource#schemaBean schemaBean} feature.           Or, use
 * the {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.AdminConsole Admin Console} to generate tables from
 * DataSource           definitions you create by hand</li>     </ul>   <li>If your ultimate
 * storage is not a SQL database:</li>     <ul>       <li>If your persistence is based on Java
 * Beans, use the           {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.serverds.DataSource#schemaBean
 * schemaBean} feature to derive DataSource definitions from            any Java bean</li>      
 * <li>write a {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.WriteCustomDataSource custom DataSource} that
 * provides the           CRUD operations you want to support.</li>     </ul>   <li>Whether or not
 * your storage is SQL, add business logic either declaratively in the        DataSource
 * definition, via {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.DmiOverview DMI}, or any combination of the
 * two:     <ul>       <li>The &lt;criteria&gt; and &lt;values&gt; properties of an {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding}           allow you to dynamically set data values
 * at transaction-processing time, using            built-in {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.VelocitySupport Velocity support}</li>       <li>Override the
 * <code>validate()</code> method of the DataSource to provide extra           custom validations
 * - just call <code>super</code> to obtain the list of errors            derived from Smart GWT
 * validations, then add to that list as required with your           own custom code</li>      
 * <li>Override the <code>execute()</code> method of the DataSource to add extra processing       
 * either before or after the Smart GWT processing</li>       <li>Use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.TransactionChaining Transaction Chaining} to dynamically set          
 * data values according to the results of earlier transactions</li>       <li>For SQL
 * DataSources, use {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.CustomQuerying SQL Templating} to change,     
 * add to or even completely replace the SQL sent to the database, and to implement          
 * special query requirements</li>       <li>For JPA DataSources, use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding#getCustomJQL custom JQL queries}           to
 * implement special query requirements</li>       <li>For Hibernate DataSources, use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding#getCustomHQL custom HQL queries}           to
 * implement special query requirements</li>      </ul>      Read more about the server-side
 * request processing flow and how to customize it in      {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.ServerDataIntegration the server integration overview}. </ul> </ul>
 * <ul> <li>If you do not have a Java server:</li>   <ul><li>If you are not obliged to use a
 * pre-existing network protocol, use the            {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.RestDataSource}</li>       <li>Otherwise, use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.ClientDataIntegration client-side data integration} features          
 * to create a custom client-side DataSource that adapts the DataSource protocol to           
 * your existing services</li>   </ul> </ul> <p><br> <b>RPCs: Unstructured Server
 * Communication</b> <P> Smart GWT also supports "unstructured" client-server operations.  These 
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCRequest}s (Remote Procedure Call Requests) are a low-level,
 * very flexible  mechanism for custom client-server communications.  In an nutshell, RPCRequests:
 * <ul> <li> may contain arbitrary data <li> are always initiated by custom code (a call to {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCManager#send RPCManager.send()}), and have their responses handled
 * by custom code (the callback passed to <code>send()</code>) </ul> <P> RPCRequests are
 * relatively rare.  Most client-server communications are better done in a  structured fashion
 * using a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest} (DataSource Request).  Note that
 * <em>any</em> RPCRequest can alternatively be framed as a {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#fetchData DataSource fetch};  depending on the
 * circumstances, this may be more convenient. <P> See the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCManager} documentation for further information on RPCRequests.
