     * case-insensitive prefix match ("foo" matches "FooBar" but not "BarFoo") <p> textMatchStyle behavior is consistent across
     * the client and all three of the built-in server DataSource implementations - SQL, Hibernate and JPA - to the maximum
     * extent that is practical. Known inconsistencies, some of which can be tweaked with configuration settings, are described
     * below<ul> <li>textMatchStyle can be disabled for any individual field with the  {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getIgnoreTextMatchStyle DataSourceField.ignoreTextMatchStyle} declaration. This
     * behavior is consistent across client and server implementations, with the proviso that case-sensitive behavior  is
     * inherently inconsistent in the server-side implementations (see below for a more detailed discussion of this)</li>
     * <li>textMatchStyle is forced to "exactCase" for {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getPrimaryKey
     * primaryKey}  fields on <code>update</code> and <code>remove</code> operations, unless {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.docs.serverds.OperationBinding#allowMultiUpdate OperationBinding.allowMultiUpdate} is in force. This
     * means that a normal update or remove operation - which is constrained by a unique primaryKey value or combination, to 
     * affect only a single data row - will use an equality match on all primaryKey fields. This is desirable because it makes
     * index usage more likely. Note that this means the key values "foo" and "FOO" are distinct, which is a change from
     * previous behavior. For most databases, this change will have no effect because most databases do not by default allow
     * primaryKey  values that only differ in case anyway - if a table has a row with a PK of "foo" and you  try to insert a
     * row with a PK of "FOO", most databases will fail with a constraint violation. However, if you are using a database hat
     * allows key values that differ only in case, and you  need to support this for some reason, you can switch the framework
     * back to the previous  behavior by setting property <code>allow.case.sensitive.pks</code> to <code>true</code> in your
     * <code>server.properties</code> file. Note, we do not recommend this; in fact, we do  not recommend the use of text
     * primaryKey fields at all. Where you have control ,we would  always recommend the use of automatically incrementing
     * numeric sequence keys.</li> <li>textMatchStyle does not apply to boolean or temporal (date, datetime, time) {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getType field types}. Such fields are always checked for equality. If  you have
     * a need for more complex matching, such as date-range checking, use AdvancedCriteria</li> <li>Critiera values for
     * temporal fields <b>must</b> be real dates (Javascript <code>Date</code> objects on the client, instances of
     * <code>java.util.Date</code> on the server). Attempting to match against a string or any other type of value will result
     * in an "always fails"  clause being generated. This behavior is how the client code has always worked, but is a  change
     * for the server-side DataSources, in the interests of consistency. The previous behavior was:<ul> <li>SQLDataSource used
     * to attempt to match the date column to the criteria value provided; if that value was an appropriately-formatted string,
     * that attempt <i>might</i> have  worked, but it would be database-specific. If you have an application that depends on 
     * this old behavior, you can switch it back on by adding the following to your <code>server.properties</code> file: 
     * <code>sql.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false</code></li> <li>HibernateDataSource and JPADataSource used to
     * skip such clauses altogether, which  results in the opposite behavior (there is an implied "always succeeds" clause,
     * because  the clause is not present in the query at all). If you have an application that depends on  this old behavior,
     * you can switch it back on by adding the following to your <code>server.properties</code> file: 
     * <code>jpa.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria: false</code> or  <code>hibernate.temporal.fields.require.date.criteria:
     * false</code>, as appropriate</li> </ul></li> <li>textMatchStyle does not apply to fields used in the joins generated to
     * satisfy  {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.serverds.DataSourceField#includeFrom includeFrom} declarations or entity
     * relations in Hibernate or JPA. Again, such comparisons are always for equality</li> <li>textMatchStyle is applied to
     * numeric fields <b>only</b> if the supplied criteria value is a string. So for a numeric field "myNumber", we will match
     * 10, 100, 110 and 1000 if a  criteria value of "10" (the quoted string) is supplied, but we will only match 10 if a 
     * criteria value of 10 (the actual number) is supplied<ul> <li>This is a change in behavior for the server-side DataSource
     * implementations, in the  interests of consistency with the client behavior. Previously, all three of the built-in
     * DataSource implementations applied textMatchStyle to numeric fields regardless of the  criteria value's type. If you
     * have an application that depends on this old behavior,  you can switch it back on by adding the following to your
     * <code>server.properties</code> file: <code>sql.substring.numeric.criteria: true</code> or 
     * <code>hibernate.substring.numeric.criteria: true</code> or  <code>jpa.substring.numeric.criteria: true</code>, as
     * appropriate</li> </ul></li> <li>"exactCase" matching cannot be made consistent across all database providers because 
     * each database has its own idea of whether case-sensitive matching should be the default,  and how to switch it on and
     * off (if that is even possible)<ul> <li>Microsoft SQL Server must have case-sensitive matching enabled by setting a 
     * case-sensitive collation when the database is created (there are more fine-grained  options, but we do not recommend
     * them because of the scope for further inconsistency,  where "exactCase" works correctly on table A but not on table B).
     * See  <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175835.aspx>MSDN</a> for details</li> <li>HSQLDB has case
     * sensitivity set with the <code>SET IGNORECASE</code> directive - <a
     * href=http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/guide/ch09.html#set_ignorecase-section>see here</a></li> <li>MySQL is case-insensitive,
     * but since it provides an easy way to do per-query, case-sensitive matching in SQL, we work around it for that database,
     * but <b>only</b> in SQL DataSources</li> </ul></li> <li>If you are using Hibernate or JPA, whether "exactCase" works as
     * expected depends  entirely on the underlying database. Unlike the SQL DataSource, where we have fine-grained control of
     * the SQL that the database executes, we are constrained by what the ORM will  allow. This prevents us from compensating
     * for database quirks, like we do with MySQL's case-insensitivity in the SQL DataSource</li> </ul>
     * <P>
     * If this enumerated value is used in a {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.ComponentXML Component XML}
     * file or server-side DataSource descriptor (.ds.xml file), use the value "startsWith".
