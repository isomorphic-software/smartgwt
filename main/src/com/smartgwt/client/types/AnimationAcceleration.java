 * Acceleration effect for animations. Can either be a ratio function or a string. Ratio functions take a value between 0
 * and 1 which represents how much of the  animation's duration has elapsed, and return another value between 0 and 1
 * indicating how close the animation is to completion. For a completely linear animation, the  function would return the
 * value it was passed. This allows you to bias animations to [for example] speed up toward the end of the animation.<br>
 * The following strings are also supported for common ratio bias effects:
