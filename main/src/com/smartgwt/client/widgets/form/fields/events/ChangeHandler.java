     * Called when a FormItem's value is about to change as the result of user interaction.  This method fires after the user
     * performed an action that would change the value of this field, but before the element itself is changed.   <P> Returning
     * false cancels the change.  Note that if what you want to do is <b>transform</b> the user's input, for example,
     * automatically change separator characters to a standard separator character, you should implement {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FormItem#setInputTransformer transformInput} rather than using a combination of
     * change() and setValue() to accomplish the same thing.  Returning false from <code>change</code> is intended for
     * rejecting input entirely, such as typing invalid characters. <p> Note that if you ask the form for the current value in
     * this handler, you will get the old value because the change has not yet been committed.  The new value is available as a
     * parameter to this method.
