     * Notification method fired when new data arrives from the server to be displayed in this ListGrid, (for example in
     * response to the user scrolling a new set of rows into view). Only applies to databound listGrids where the {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#getData data} attribute is a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.ResultSet}. This
     * ResultSet may have been created manually and applied to the grid via a call to {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#setData setData()} or may have been created and automatically assigned if
     * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#fetchData fetchData()} was used to populate the grid.  This method is
     * fired directly in response to {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.ResultSet#addDataArrivedHandler dataArrived()} firing on
     * the data object. <P> Note that <code>dataArrived()</code>, unlike {@link
     * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#addDataChangedHandler ListGrid.dataChanged()}, only fires in limited
     * circumstances - when data for a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.ResultSet} arrives from the server due to a fetch or
     * cache invalidation, or as a result of filtering.  If you want to catch all data changes, you should instead react to
     * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#addDataChangedHandler ListGrid.dataChanged()}.

     * @return {@link HandlerRegistration} used to remove this handler
