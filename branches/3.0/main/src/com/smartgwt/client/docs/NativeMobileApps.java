/**
 * <h3>Creating Native Mobile Apps (Titanium, Phonegap)</h3>
 * "Packaging" technologies such as Titanium and Phonegap can be used to take a Smart GWT web application and package it as
 * an installable native application that can be delivered via the "App Store" for the target mobile platform. 
 * Applications packaged in this way have access to native phone functionality that web applications in the phone's browser
 * cannot access. <P> Both Titanium and Phonegap are open source mobile development frameworks which provide access to the 
 * underlying native device API's such as the accelerometer, geolocation, and UI. Both frameworks enable  application
 * development using only Javascript, CSS and HTML. Additionally they provide development environments  that work across a
 * wide variety of devices. <P> Phonegap has good support for native device API's as noted <a
 * href='http://www.phonegap.com/features' onclick="window.open('http://www.phonegap.com/features');return
 * false;">here</a>. Titanium also has similar <a
 * href='http://www.appcelerator.com/products/native-iphone-android-development/'
 * onclick="window.open('http://www.appcelerator.com/products/native-iphone-android-development/');return
 * false;">support</a>.  There are differences between the two environments and how they expose their API's, though both
 * provide  XCode compatible projects that can be compiled and run from the XCode IDE. See the subsections for additional
 * details and references.
