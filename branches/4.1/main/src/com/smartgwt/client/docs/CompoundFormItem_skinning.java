/**
 * When skinning basic FormItems like SelectItem and TextItem, consider that compound form items
 * like DateItem and ComboBox reuse simpler items like SelectItem and TextItem, so adding a border
 * to SelectItem would also apply a border to each select item within DateItem.<br> To avoid such
 * side-effects, if you want to add styling to all SelectItems used in your  application, you can
 * create an application-specific subclass like MySelectItem and apply  properties there.<br>
