/**
 * A String of HTML, such as "<span class='somestyle'>text</span>". <P> In many contexts, such as {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Button#getTitle title} and {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid#formatCellValue
 * ListGrid.formatCellValue}, an HTML String can be specified, allowing you to use normal HTML tags and CSS to do
 * formatting or styling.   <P> However, bear in mind that if you attempt any kind of layout or advanced styling in such an
 * HTML string, different browsers may render the HTML differently - use Smart GWT {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.layout.Layout layout} and {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas#getStyleName styling}
 * features wherever possible to avoid this.  See also CSSStyleName.
