/**
 * <h3>Google Application Engine (GAE)</h3>
 * Google App Engine (GAE) is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Google, which supports
 * cloud deployment of applications written in Java and other languages, as well as SQL or JPA
 * access to highly scalable storage (both Google CloudSQL and BigTable-based solutions). <p>
 * Smart GWT applications, including those based on the Smart GWT Server Framework, can be
 * deployed to GAE and can integrate with Google CloudSQL either via SQLDataSource or via JPA, and
 * can also use Google's BigTable-based storage via JPA. <P> For further information, setup
 * instructions and example configuration, see our <a
